# Vaadin TouchKit + Vaadin CDI

A very thin example how to use CDI with Vaadin TouchKit application.

To see what is actually needed to accomplish this, look at individual commits to this project.

To try out the example, deploy it to a Java EE 6+ container or use either of following Mave goals:

    mvn package org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-maven-plugin:run

or

    mvn package org.apache.openejb.maven:tomee-maven-plugin:run
